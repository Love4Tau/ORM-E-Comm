  ## Description
  In this project, I used Object-Relational Mapping(ORM) to build a backend for an e-commerce site. I got to work with mysql and express and created multiple routes to handle HTTP methods! I ran into some trouble with using my tags PUT request when I was recording the video walkthrough, so I tried to cut that part of the final walkthrough video.

  ## Credits
  I re-watched our bootcamp cloud recordings for assistance with creating the routes: https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/5093/external_tools/249

  I used the xpert AI tool when I ran into errors(specifically sql errors)
